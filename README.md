# AssemblerProject_UniversityProject
This repository contains a university project I coded with a partner for 20465 System Programming Laboratory (https://www-e.openu.ac.il/courses/20465.htm)
The project is a simulation of an assembler. The program is able to assemble a custom made assembly language defined the project's description. 

The program can be used by running it with the example files supplied in the repository.
